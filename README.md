# ContractConfigurator-SpaceJunk

## Synopsis

Throughout the Kerbin system, rocket debris abounds. This contract pack puts that debris to work by creating two similar contracts.

The first requires the Player to safely recover (most) of a targeted piece of debris. These contracts are very like the recovery contracts that exist in the stock game, except they involve debris.

The second requires the Player to destroy the targeted debris. How they do that is up to them. crashing and explosions sounds like good methods.

## Installation

Downlaod the latest release from the GitHub respository. Expand the ZIP file and place the contents in your _GameData_ folder.

## Requirements

To use a custom contract pack you will need [ContractConfigurator](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/91625-130-contract-configurator-v1232-2017-08-03/) by nightingale.

Both contract types have the same, minimalistic, in-game requirements, that you have some junk to deal with. No specific parts are required, although the [Advanced Grabbing Unit](https://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Advanced_Grabbing_Unit) would obviously be of benefit.

The custom contracts will appear in Mission Control once you have some junk to dispose of, upon the next contract generation cycle.

## Points of Interest

It is assumed the Player will avoid using the _Terminate_ function in the Tracking Station, as that will cause havoc with fulfilling the contracts.

In order for a piece of debris to be targeted, it must be marked as _Debris_. Technically any vessel can be marked this way. Simply fly the vessel in question and use the _Rename Vessel_ functionality to change the craft's icon to that of _Debris_.

When a craft stages and leaves debris behind, each piece of debris will have the same name, auto generated, based on the name of the current vessel. This may make the contract's true target a bit vague. Again, fly each piece of debris in turn and change its name to something unique. The respective contracts will update to show the new name automatically.

## Future Plans

- Be more specific how a vessel is recovered or destroyed e.g. must crash into the ground
- Be more specific where the vessel is recovered e.g at a waypoint
- Create a "not in my back yard" contract, which requests a bit of debris is moved from here to there
- Integrate with CKAN (manual installation is currently required)
